Hello Professor!!!This is Gourav Pilaka, youcan call me Gary.I  did  my  bachelor’s  in  computer science  back  in  India. You wouldn’t believe, my favorite course  was  web  programming  in  my  undergrad. It  was quite interesting to develop web pages, because html was the only language that gave actual real outputs from the code.  I  started  improving  the  layout  and  added  more decorations  to  web  pages  as  I got  more  involved. In  my first semester of masters, Itook database, data structures and  computer  systems.  Currently,  I  enrolled  for  cloud systems and foundations in CPS apart from web server.I did a project on Restaurant Management Systems usingMySQLin the first semester. As I am already into web programming, I would be more than  happy  to  learn  and  improve  my  skills  through  this 
course.Right  from  my  high  school  I  wanted  to  have  a website of my own, I hope I could develop one after this course. And If things go well and I find myself as a guy for web  development,  Web  Developer  would  be  the  role  I would be looking for, once I graduate. And  I  have  to  say,  you  got  an  amazing energy  professor. The way gave us the outline of course was so crystal clear.I  especially  liked  that  part  when  you  explained  all  thecomments by students.Looking  forward  for  more  and  more  interesting  classes with you :)
